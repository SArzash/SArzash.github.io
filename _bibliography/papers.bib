	abstract = {As a function of connectivity, spring networks exhibit a critical transition between floppy and rigid phases at an isostatic threshold. For connectivity below this threshold, fiber networks were recently shown theoretically to exhibit a rigidity transition with corresponding critical signatures as a function of strain. Experimental collagen networks were also shown to be consistent with these predictions. We develop a scaling theory for this strain-controlled transition. Using a real-space renormalization approach, we determine relations between the critical exponents governing the transition, which we verify for the strain-controlled transition using numerical simulations of both triangular lattice-based and packing-derived fiber networks.},

	abstract = {Networks of filamentous actin (F-actin) are important for the mechanics of most animal cells. These cytoskeletal networks are highly dynamic, with a variety of actin-associated proteins that control cross-linking, polymerization and force generation in the cytoskeleton. Inspired by recent rheological experiments on reconstituted solutions of dynamic actin filaments, we report a theoretical model that describes stress relaxation behavior of these solutions in the presence of severing proteins. We show that depending on the kinetic rates of assembly, disassembly, and severing, one can observe both length-dependent and length-independent relaxation behavior.},

	abstract = {The mechanics of disordered fibrous networks such as those that make up the extracellular matrix are strongly dependent on the local connectivity or coordination number. For biopolymer networks this coordination number is typically between 3 and 4. Such networks are sub-isostatic and linearly unstable to deformation with only central force interactions, but exhibit a mechanical phase transition between floppy and rigid states under strain. The introduction of weak bending interactions stabilizes these networks and suppresses the critical signatures of this transition. We show that applying external stress can also stabilize subisostatic networks with only tensile central force interactions, i.e., a ropelike potential. Moreover, we find that the linear shear modulus shows a power-law scaling with the external normal stress, with a non-mean-field exponent. For networks with finite bending rigidity, we find that the critical stain shifts to lower values under prestress.},

	abstract = {Fibrous networks such as collagen are common in physiological systems. One important function of these networks is to provide mechanical stability for cells and tissues. At physiological levels of connectivity, such networks would be mechanically unstable with only central-force interactions. While networks can be stabilized by bending interactions, it has also been shown that they exhibit a critical transition from floppy to rigid as a function of applied strain. Beyond a certain strain threshold, it is predicted that underconstrained networks with only central-force interactions exhibit a discontinuity in the shear modulus. We study the finite-size scaling behavior of this transition and identify both the mechanical discontinuity and critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit. We find both non-mean-field behavior and evidence for a hyperscaling relation for the critical exponents, for which the network stiffness is analogous to the heat capacity for thermal phase transitions. Further evidence for this is also found in the self-averaging properties of fiber networks.},

	abstract = {When subject to applied strain, fiber networks exhibit nonlinear elastic stiffening. Recent theory and experiments have shown that this phenomenon is controlled by an underlying mechanical phase transition that is critical in nature. Growing simulation evidence points to non-mean-field behavior for this transition and a hyperscaling relation has been proposed to relate the corresponding critical exponents. Here, we report simulations on two distinct network structures in three dimensions. By performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we test hyperscaling and identify various critical exponents. From the apparent validity of hyperscaling, as well as the non-mean-field exponents we observe, our results suggest that the upper critical dimension for the strain-controlled phase transition is above three, in contrast to the jamming transition that represents another athermal, mechanical phase transition.},

This transition is punctuated by an anomalous peak in the apparent Poisson{\textquoteright}s ratio and other critical signatures such as diverging nonaffine strain fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Biopolymer networks are common in biological systems from the cytoskeleton of individual cells to collagen in the extracellular matrix. The mechanics of these systems under applied strain can be explained in some cases by a phase transition from soft to rigid states. For collagen networks, it has been shown that this transition is critical in nature and it is predicted to exhibit diverging fluctuations near a critical strain that depends on the network's connectivity and structure. Whereas prior work focused mostly on shear deformation that is more accessible experimentally, here we study the mechanics of such networks under an applied bulk or isotropic extension. We confirm that the bulk modulus of subisostatic fiber networks exhibits similar critical behavior as a function of bulk strain. We find different non-mean-field exponents for bulk as opposed to shear. We also confirm a similar hyperscaling relation to what previously found for shear.},
