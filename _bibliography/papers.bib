	abstract = {As a function of connectivity, spring networks exhibit a critical transition between floppy and rigid phases at an isostatic threshold. For connectivity below this threshold, fiber networks were recently shown theoretically to exhibit a rigidity transition with corresponding critical signatures as a function of strain. Experimental collagen networks were also shown to be consistent with these predictions. We develop a scaling theory for this strain-controlled transition. Using a real-space renormalization approach, we determine relations between the critical exponents governing the transition, which we verify for the strain-controlled transition using numerical simulations of both triangular lattice-based and packing-derived fiber networks.},

These cytoskeletal networks are highly dynamic, with a variety of actin-associated proteins that control cross-linking, polymerization and force generation in the cytoskeleton. Inspired by recent rheological experiments on reconstituted solutions of dynamic actin filaments, we report a theoretical model that describes stress relaxation behavior of these solutions in the presence of severing proteins. We show that depending on the kinetic rates of assembly, disassembly, and severing, one can observe both length-dependent and length-independent relaxation behavior.},

For biopolymer networks this coordination number is typically between 3 and 4. Such networks are sub-isostatic and linearly unstable to deformation with only central force interactions, but exhibit a mechanical phase transition between floppy and rigid states under strain. The introduction of weak bending interactions stabilizes these networks and suppresses the critical signatures of this transition. We show that applying external stress can also stabilize subisostatic networks with only tensile central force interactions, i.e., a ropelike potential. Moreover, we find that the linear shear modulus shows a power-law scaling with the external normal stress, with a non-mean-field exponent. For networks with finite bending rigidity, we find that the critical stain shifts to lower values under prestress.},

At physiological levels of connectivity, such networks would be mechanically unstable with only central-force interactions. While networks can be stabilized by bending interactions, it has also been shown that they exhibit a critical transition from floppy to rigid as a function of applied strain. Beyond a certain strain threshold, it is predicted that underconstrained networks with only central-force interactions exhibit a discontinuity in the shear modulus. We study the finite-size scaling behavior of this transition and identify both the mechanical discontinuity and critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit. We find both non-mean-field behavior and evidence for a hyperscaling relation for the critical exponents, for which the network stiffness is analogous to the heat capacity for thermal phase transitions. Further evidence for this is also found in the self-averaging properties of fiber networks.},

Recent theory and experiments have shown that this phenomenon is controlled by an underlying mechanical phase transition that is critical in nature. Growing simulation evidence points to non-mean-field behavior for this transition and a hyperscaling relation has been proposed to relate the corresponding critical exponents. Here, we report simulations on two distinct network structures in three dimensions. By performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we test hyperscaling and identify various critical exponents. From the apparent validity of hyperscaling, as well as the non-mean-field exponents we observe, our results suggest that the upper critical dimension for the strain-controlled phase transition is above three, in contrast to the jamming transition that represents another athermal, mechanical phase transition.},

The mechanics of these systems under applied strain can be explained in some cases by a phase transition from soft to rigid states. For collagen networks, it has been shown that this transition is critical in nature and it is predicted to exhibit diverging fluctuations near a critical strain that depends on the network's connectivity and structure. Whereas prior work focused mostly on shear deformation that is more accessible experimentally, here we study the mechanics of such networks under an applied bulk or isotropic extension. We confirm that the bulk modulus of subisostatic fiber networks exhibits similar critical behavior as a function of bulk strain. We find different nonmean-field exponents for bulk as opposed to shear. We also confirm a similar hyperscaling relation to what was previously found for shear.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify these scaling relations and identify anomalous entropic elasticity with sublinear &#119879; dependence in the linear elastic regime.

The interplay between different biopolymer components in such composite networks remains unclear. In this work, we use 2D coarse-grained models to study the nonlinear strain-stiffening behavior of composites. We introduce a local volume constraint to model the incompressibility of {HA}. We also perform rheology experiments on composites of collagen with {HA}. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the linear shear modulus of composite networks can be increased by approximately an order of magnitude above the corresponding moduli of the pure components. Our model shows that this synergistic effect can be understood in terms of the local incompressibility of {HA}, which acts to suppress density fluctuations of the collagen matrix with which it is entangled.},

One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solidlike to a fluidlike state or vice versa. Here we introduce a way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity by using �tunable degrees of freedom.� We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.},

	abstract = {Simple vertex models, where the cell shape is defined as a network of edges and vertices, have made useful predictions about the collective behavior of confluent biological tissues, including rigidity transitions. Quite a few different versions of vertex models have appeared in the literature, and they propose substantial differences in how the mechanical energy depends on vertex positions, yet all of them seem to make correct predictions. To understand how this is possible, we search for universality in the emergent mechanical behavior � including the shear modulus defined in the limit of zero strain rate and the viscoelastic response at finite strain rates � of six different vertex models. We identify a class of models with a well-defined shear modulus, and demonstrate that these models all exhibit a cross-over from a soft or floppy regime to a stiff regime. While the parameter that controls the crossover is different in each model, we find that the observed cell shape index (the ratio of the cell perimeter to the square root of the cell area) is a good observable order parameter for the crossover. We also find that the finite strain-rate viscoelastic response of all models exhibits a universal scaling with frequency, following the Zener model in the rigid phase and Burgers model in the fluid phase. This suggests there is a broad class of vertex models with universal mechanical features, and helps to explain why many different vertex models are able to robustly predict these features in experiments.},
