<!-- My overall research interests include understanding the mechanical and dynamic properties of soft and biological materials from biopolymer networks to whole tissues. Biopolymer networks such as collagen are constantly under both external and internal stresses. A common feature in the mechanical response of such natural biopolymer materials is that they become stronger as they are deformed. Recent studies have shown that these fiber networks undergo a mechanical phase transition from a soft to a rigid state under nonlinear deformations. Understanding this critical transition helps us to provide a productive theory for real biopolymer networks. Strikingly, on the multicellular scale, it has also been shown that the behavior of tissues can be explained in terms of a transition from a fluid-like to a solid-like state based on their geometrical features and cellular motility. -->
