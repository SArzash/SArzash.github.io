I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Shiladitya Banerjee](https://shiladitya-banerjee.com/) in the Physics Department at Georgia Institute of Technology. Previosly, I worked jointly with [Prof. M. Lisa Manning](https://mmanning.expressions.syr.edu/) (Syracuse University) and [Prof. Andrea J. Liu](https://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/andrea-liu) (University of Pennsylvania). In 2021, I received my Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Rice University under the supervision of [Prof. Fred C. MacKintosh](https://fcmack.web.rice.edu/).

During my Ph.D., I worked mostly on the rheology and critical aspects of mechanical phase transitions in biopolymer networks. My Ph.D. thesis is available [here](https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/111740).
