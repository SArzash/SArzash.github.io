These systems can learn desired responses, encode memory, and robustly reorganize under repeated stimuli, much like artificial neural networks but without requiring processors to adjust their weights. Here, we extend this paradigm to morphogenesis and show that the epithelium can be viewed as tunable matter and that epithelial convergent extension (CE) can be understood as a self-tuning process. Using a vertex model with active interfacial tensions, we systematically compare distinct tension-update strategies, including externally imposed shear, global gradient descent optimization, and decentralized local feedback rules. We find that while all methods can generate tissue elongation, only local orientation- and length-sensitive rules reproduce key experimental features of CE, such as supracellular actomyosin pattern formation, cell shape changes, and junctional alignment. In contrast, global optimization produces homogeneous tension patterns and mechanically fragile states. By interpreting CE through the lens of tuning, our framework bridges the physics of tunable matter with developmental biology, revealing how simple, local rules enable tissues to efficiently orchestrate complex morphogenetic outcomes through decentralized mechanical adaptation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/T1.png"></div> <div id="ruppel_morphogenesis--chip_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Morphogenesis-on-chip: A minimal in vitro assay for cell intercalation highlights the importance of interfacial tension and migratory forces</div> <div class="author">Ruppel, Artur, Misiak, Vladimir,  <em>Arzash, Sadjad</em>, Herrador, Daniel Selma, Cappello, Giovanni, Boudou, Thomas, Manning, Lisa, Fagotto, François, and Balland, Martial </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>bioRxiv</em> Jul 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.30.662274v1" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/T1.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Cell intercalation, the dynamic exchange of cellular neighbors, is fundamental to embryonic morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and wound healing. Despite extensive study in complex tissues, the minimal mechanical requirements driving intercalation remain poorly understood due to confounding tissue level interactions. Here, we present a novel morphogenesis-on-chip assay utilizing micropatterned cell quadruplets. This system isolates the elementary unit of intercalation while enabling quantitative force and shape measurements. Cross-shaped micropatterns generate stable four cell configurations in MDCK epithelial cells. Surprisingly, these cells spontaneously undergo T1 transitions autonomously. We combined live imaging with force inference and traction force microscopy, which revealed that intercalation emerges from two distinct mechanisms: interfacial tension dynamics and differential cell migration. Specifically, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and increased relative tension. Similarly, we show a correlation between central junction shrinkage and migratory forces. We successfully adapted the assay to Xenopus mesoderm cells, revealing conserved mechanical principles across cell types. Furthermore, experimentally derived effective energy landscapes closely match theoretical vertex model predictions, and suggest a dominant role for migratory forces in driving intercalation. This confirms that our minimal system recapitulates the fundamental physics of intercalation. This approach provides the first quantitative framework for studying intercalation mechanics in isolation and establishes a versatile platform for investigating morphogenetic processes.

Quite a few different versions of vertex models have appeared in the literature, and they propose substantial differences in how the mechanical energy depends on vertex positions, yet all seem to make correct predictions. To understand how this is possible, we search for universality in the emergent mechanical behavior-including the shear modulus defined in the limit of zero-strain rate and the viscoelastic response at finite strain rates-of six different vertex models. We identify a class of models with a well-defined shear modulus, and demonstrate that these models all exhibit a crossover from a soft or floppy regime to a stiff regime. We find that the observed cell shape index (the ratio of the cell perimeter to the square root of the cell area) is a good observable order parameter for the crossover, even though the input model parameter that controls the crossover is different in each model. We also find that the finite-strain-rate viscoelastic response of all models exhibits a universal scaling with frequency, following the Zener model in the rigid phase and Burgers model in the fluid phase. The observation that a geometric observable like cell shape governs the transition, rather than a topological observable such as coordination number, suggests that second-order rigidity may be a good framework for explaining this universality. It generates an empirical prediction that a broad class of vertex models with second-order rigidity transitions should also exhibit these universal mechanical features, and helps to explain why many different vertex models are able to robustly predict these features in experiments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/learning_vertex.png"></div> <div id="arzash_rigidity_2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Rigidity of epithelial tissues as a double optimization problem</div> <div class="author"> <em>Arzash, Sadjad</em>, Tah, Indrajit, Liu, Andrea J., and Manning, M.

Here we introduce a way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity by using �tunable degrees of freedom.� We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition.

Recent theoretical and experimental efforts have shed light on the mechanics of single component networks. Most real biopolymer networks, however, are composites made of elements with different rigidity. For instance, the extracellular matrix in mammalian tissues consists of stiff collagen fibers in a background matrix of flexible polymers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). The interplay between different biopolymer components in such composite networks remains unclear. In this work, we use 2D coarse-grained models to study the nonlinear strain-stiffening behavior of composites. We introduce a local volume constraint to model the incompressibility of HA. We also perform rheology experiments on composites of collagen with HA. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the linear shear modulus of composite networks can be increased by approximately an order of magnitude above the corresponding moduli of the pure components. Our model shows that this synergistic effect can be understood in terms of the local incompressibility of HA, which acts to suppress density fluctuations of the collagen matrix with which it is entangled.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/finite_T.jpg"></div> <div id="arzash_mechanical_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mechanical criticality of fiber networks at a finite temperature</div> <div class="author"> <em>Arzash, Sadjad</em>, Gannavarapu, Anupama, and MacKintosh, Fred C. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Physical Review E</em> Nov 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.054403" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/finite_T.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>At zero temperature, spring networks with connectivity below Maxwell’s isostatic threshold undergo a mechanical phase transition from a floppy state at small strains to a rigid state for applied shear strain above a critical strain threshold.

For biopolymer networks this coordination number is typically between 3 and 4. Such networks are sub-isostatic and linearly unstable to deformation with only central force interactions, but exhibit a mechanical phase transition between floppy and rigid states under strain. The introduction of weak bending interactions stabilizes these networks and suppresses the critical signatures of this transition. We show that applying external stress can also stabilize subisostatic networks with only tensile central force interactions, i.e., a ropelike potential. Moreover, we find that the linear shear modulus shows a power-law scaling with the external normal stress, with a non-mean-field exponent. For networks with finite bending rigidity, we find that the critical stain shifts to lower values under prestress.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> <center> © Copyright 2025 Sadjad Arzash.
